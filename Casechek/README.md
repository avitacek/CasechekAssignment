# Casechek Assignment

#Below are Common Instruction for running the code on a local server using Terminal

These are the instruction for viewing the assignment.
	1. Download the zip file or clone it to your local machine, using the git hub GUI or in terminal if on a Mac, PC can do the same in the DOM.
	2. Make sure you have (most current Node,js and NPM Installed).
	3. CD in to the cloned repo folder CasecheckAssignment then cd in Casechek folder.
	4. Run npm install command line in Terminal.
	5. Run npm update command line in Terminal.
	6. Run ng serve command line in Terminal.
	7. Open up a modern broswer to http://localhost:4200
	8. Press the search results and see the pull api data.

This is a different APi then originally provided, I was having issues parsing the data beign returned by those api's (formatting issues).

You can look through the construction files and see the scss files using sass for the styling, I have a global.js file included for further javascript actions if needed (just console logging currently to prove it is being complied in the package on runtime and the html is using common bootstrap syntax and the app works responively).

I did not complete the sorting function, as the search is already sorted per input value. It can be done. Just more time needed and did not want to overdue the request.

I have a wireframe attached to see the 3 states of the app in mind.
I could design this much more to make the UI much more user friendly for the demographic audience we most likely will be targeting.

Thanks for the opportunity
Reach out if you have any questions.
Excited to hear some good news.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
